     * This method allows us to have mobs that spawn naturally over time in our structure.
     * No other mobs will spawn in the structure of the same entity classification.
     * The reason you want to match the classifications is so that your structure's mob
     * will contribute to that classification's cap. Otherwise, it may cause a runaway
     * spawning of the mob that will never stop.
     *
     * NOTE: getDefaultSpawnList is for monsters only and getDefaultCreatureSpawnList is
     *       for creatures only. If you want to add entities of another classification,
     *       use the StructureSpawnListGatherEvent to add water_creatures, water_ambient,
     *       ambient, or misc mobs. Use that event to add/remove mobs from structures
     *       that are not your own.

     * This is where extra checks can be done to determine if the structure can spawn here.

     * Notice how the biome is also passed in. Though, you are not going to do any biome
     * checking here as you should've added this structure to the biomes you
     * wanted already with the biome load event.
     * 
     * Basically, this method is used for determining if the land is at a suitable height,
     * if certain other structures are too close or not, or some other restrictive condition.
     *
     * For example, Pillager Outposts added a check to make sure it cannot spawn within 10 chunk of a Village.
     * (Bedrock Edition seems to not have the same check)
     * 
     * 
     * Also, please for the love of god, do not do dimension checking here.
     * If you do and another mod's dimension is trying to spawn your structure,
     * the locate command will make minecraft hang forever and break the game.
     *
     * Instead, use the removeStructureSpawningFromSelectedDimension method in
     * StructureTutorialMain class. If you check for the dimension there and do not add your
     * structure's spacing into the chunk generator, the structure will not spawn in that dimension!
